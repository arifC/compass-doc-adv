# Overview

This page is intended to present the use cases and general information on Compass. 

## What is Compass?

With Compass you can manage multiple Kyma runtimes and their connected applications in a multi-tenant way. The **management capabilities** of Compass comprise the following features:
- Runtime management: CRUD, Labels, Agents
- Application management: CRUD, Labels, APIs/Events, Webhooks

## What should Compass be used for?

The problem solved by Compass is to centrally manage runtimes and applications. This becomes especially difficult in large enterprise system landscapes.
